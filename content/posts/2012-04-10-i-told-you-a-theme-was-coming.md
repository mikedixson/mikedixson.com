Well I did say, [I felt a theme coming on][1], and so tada!!! Here it is. It&#8217;s not the most widely different theme. But it&#8217;s built as a child theme on the <a title="WordPress.org" href="http://wordpress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress.org</a>&#8216;s default theme. I did this for a couple of reasons. FIrstly so I could play with child themes, but mainly so that it&#8217;s sustainable. When I update the parent theme my child theme should (in theory) not need any modification in order to keep working.  
Of course I&#8217;ll test any theme updates on my staging site first to be sure of that.

There was an additional bonus of using the <a title="WordPress.org" href="http://WordPress.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress.org</a> theme. It seems to be responsive. So, with only mild aesthetic tweaking my theme also works on tablets and smart phones.

I think this theme expresses a bit of my character and style and I&#8217;m very pleased with it.
