# Moving&#8230;again!

I have moved flat a fair few times in my life. No more than is reasonable but plenty enough to be sick of it.

# Two Things Yes!

Two things have occurred to me of late.  
Whilst making a request for a referral at the doctors I was told my present address was outside of the catchment area of my doctors, whom I&#8217;d registered with whilst at my previous place.  
I could still make it to that doctor&#8217;s surgery just fine and didn&#8217;t cause them to run late by getting there late every time due to some arduous journey. So it was a bit irksome.  
Further more I knew I was due to move in less than three months and I didn&#8217;t know where to, so any attempt to register at a new doctor&#8217;s surgery would be equally as invalid.

# I am not a location

That I might need to set up a postal redirect also occurred to me. I have very little post coming to my flat presently so I could probably get away with just changing some addresses. However there&#8217;s always the chance I&#8217;d miss one.  
I don&#8217;t know how long I&#8217;ll be at my next place of residence as I now know I&#8217;m staying with a work colleague for a while. After that, I&#8217;ll be moving again, my hope is that the move will be to somewhere I own and then I&#8217;ll be there for a long long time.  
But I got to thinking that the postal system is hideously outdated. Why do I hand out an address of a physical location, rather than handing out an address relating to me and then registering a postal address with one central body whom would join the dots. Similar to DNS.  
Google don&#8217;t hand out the ip address to their servers, they give us a friendly name to reach it by and it&#8217;s registered what ip address(es) that name related to.

# Modern Living = Modern Solution

So I&#8217;d like to propose the above decoupling of physical location from person and also propose that doctors surgeries allow for a wider catchment area and if I can make it to a surgery under my own steam within an hour or so I should be allowed to not have to keep chopping and changing doctors.
