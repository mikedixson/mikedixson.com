This will be a continually updated list of my favourite Linux CLI tools

  * ZSH with OhMyZsh installed
  * Disk Usage
      * NCurses Disk Usage &#8211; CLI graphical and browseable disk space explorer.
      * `sudo apt install ncdu`
      * Can also write output to a file to explore at a different time to scanning the disk
  * Text Editor
      * I&#8217;m a Nano guy (sorry Vi guys).
      * This syntax highlighting resource is very useful  
        <https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc> 
  * Shell Management
      * Byobu
      * Absolutely love how easy this makes running a complex multi-pane, multi-window set up. Makes my life a lot easier and more productive
