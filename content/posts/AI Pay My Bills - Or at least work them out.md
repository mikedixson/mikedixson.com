### AI Pay My Bills - Or at Least Work Them Out

#### Summary
This post shares a quick lifehack for splitting bills using AI tools. By leveraging Google Lens to capture text from a restaurant bill and pasting it into ChatGPT's mobile app, you can quickly and easily divide costs among diners. 

Here's an example:
Imagine a bill for three adults and two kids at a restaurant where kids eat free from the kids' menu. One child also had garlic bread and mini pigs in blankets. You want to work out everyone's share, including the service charge.

With the text from the receipt—however poorly formatted—ChatGPT efficiently split the bill, itemising the costs per person. You can even specify which items belong to whom and get a clear breakdown of what you need to pay.

#### Additionally
I've used this method twice this week, and it works like a charm. While I usually don't use the ChatGPT mobile app often, I now realise that I can directly upload the receipt image next time, skipping the Google Lens step altogether. 

This little trick saves time and ensures accuracy when splitting bills, making it perfect for anyone who dines out in groups.
