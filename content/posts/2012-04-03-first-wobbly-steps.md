So since making my post [14 Stone Wobble][1] I&#8217;ve been making the changes I said I would. So I have up&#8217;d my exercise amount, lowered the amount of food I&#8217;m eating, and I&#8217;m eating healthier foods.  
It&#8217;s actually been pretty easy to make the changes. However what&#8217;s not been hard is being hungry all the time. The only time I&#8217;ve not been hungry is when I had a protein burst in the form of a turkey stir fry for dinner. Turkey being lower in fat than chicken. ðŸ™‚

Hopefully tomorrow will be easier as I cooked double the portions for dinner tonight and the other half is in the fridge for lunch tomorrow.

I won&#8217;t blog continually about weight loss and such but these first few steps/changes are the important ones so I feel it&#8217;s best to put something down about them.
