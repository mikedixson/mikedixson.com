I&#8217;ve been laid up lately with a broken leg and consequentially I&#8217;ve been watching a lot of tv. I&#8217;ve been surprised that there&#8217;s actually **some** good shows out there worth watching and also just channel upon channel of crap.

I got to thinking, how to do I get to find all the good tv, that I&#8217;m interested in watching nowadays. Largely I&#8217;m just flicking thru channels and find something, there are also some decent tv listings sites. But I wondered if there&#8217;s not a better way. Really I want to be able to find tv shows based on a load of symantec data. I want to be able to say I&#8217;m interested in these topics, now plot me a days tv watching based on my interests.

The other thing that occurs to me is what will the future of tv broadcasting and scheduling look like. It&#8217;s already less linear than it was with things like iplayer and itv on demand etc.  
So when there&#8217;s a cloud of recorded shows floating around in the ether what&#8217;s going to be the method for scheduling shows then, will it be entirely pulled by the user or will broadcasters broadcast a set schedule even though you can realistically watch the show whenever?

I wonder what the industry has in mind? I also wonder what users want? The schedule provides a pattern to life and familiarity where as everything on demand means that discussing tv is no longer as useful a social currency.
