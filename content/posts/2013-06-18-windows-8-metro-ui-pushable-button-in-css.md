I recently had a request to make a big green button, I decided to steer clear ofÂ skeuomorphism and to go with a flat clear design. As such I thought I&#8217;d ape the design of the Metro UI used on Windows Phones.

Here&#8217;s a link to the code I pulled together from various bits of the interweb.
