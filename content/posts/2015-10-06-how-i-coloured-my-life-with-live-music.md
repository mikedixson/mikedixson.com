Some years ago now I used to live in suburbia and work in the city, 1.5 hours each way door to door 15 hours of my life a week taken up by moving my flesh and bones to another location.

Not only was this a waste of my time, but sitting idly reading thru the newspaper on the way home I would see gig listings for gigs that were due to imminently start and I was already heading in the wrong direction from. I&#8217;ve since made a point of filling my evenings with live music and here&#8217;s how I achieve it.

## Automatically Find Gigs

I scrobble all the tracks I listen to, from my phone, my home stereo system, everything, to <a href="http://last.fm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Last.fm</a> <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/mikedixson" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.last.fm/user/mikedixson</a>  
This means that my Last.fm data is a pretty complete picture of my musical tastes.

I use the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.songkick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songkick </a>application on my smartphone to scan my Last.fm profile for artists to track. Song kick then keeps an eye out for gigs posted by artists I like and alerts me on my phone when a new gig is posted.  
I&#8217;ve also got <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bandsintown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BandsInTown </a>installed, but this doesn&#8217;t seem to let me know about as many gigs as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.songkick" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songkick </a>does.

## Money&#8217;s not a problem

If I hear about a gig within the first couple of weeks after pay day I&#8217;ll usually just book the ticket. But towards the end of the month, like most of you, money&#8217;s a little tighter. So what I do is whenever I see a gig that I want to go to I set myself a reminder using <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/landing/now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Now</a> or <a href="https://keep.google.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Keep</a> to go off on my next pay day.

That way, come pay day I buy a load of tickets to gigs and set up my coming months.

## Size might be everything

I like a lot of small bands that I&#8217;ve discovered by going to small/medium size festivals and listening to less mainstream radio like <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/6music" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BBC 6 Music</a>.

As a result a lot of the tickets I buy are between £5-£15 a ticket. Much better than shelling out £60-£100 on one gig.

## Ticket to ride

A lot of my tickets nowadays are bought thru the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fm.dice" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dice app</a> or thru <a href="https://www.songkick.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Songkick </a>themselves.  
Both of these resellers allow for digital only tickets and no fees!

This keep the price down, and saves me having to hunt around in &#8216;safe places&#8217; for tickets for gigs that I&#8217;ve booked 6 months ago.

Dice app also has a pretty nice interface to just go scrolling thru looking for other gigs that you might not have otherwise known about and then buy tickets for them too.
