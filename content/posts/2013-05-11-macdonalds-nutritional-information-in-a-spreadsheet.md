I always like reading the stats on the back of the place mat in MacDonald&#8217;s and I&#8217;m always amazed at how many calories there are in each and fat and so on. But I wanted to be able to sort these statistics as I liked to be able to compare and, hopefully, make better choices when I did wander into the fast food establishment.

So I&#8217;ve begun work on a spreadsheet. I figured I&#8217;d make it a globally editable Google Doc, so that I could enter the stats and let the world at large keep the document up to date too.  
So here&#8217;s my spreadsheet, literally a work in progress as I&#8217;m adding rows now.  
<a title="MacDonald's UK Nutritional Information Spreadsheet" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AmAy4C-fRammdFJtQ0MtRHMtbEdoZGprNnM2X1dzTlE&usp=sharing" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MacDonald&#8217;s UK Nutritional Information Spreadsheet</a>

Please feel free to add data to the spreadsheet and update it accordingly. _Note that these stats are for the UK portions of MacDonald&#8217;s._
