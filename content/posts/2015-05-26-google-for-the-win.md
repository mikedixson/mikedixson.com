  Last month Google+ introduced Collections https://plus.google.com/collections/welcome
  A devilishly simple way to group your posts by topic.
  
  When you create a Collection you set the audience, so you can have private collections for posts on a topic to share with a particular audience, or you can have public collections that anyone can follow.

Last month Google+ introduced Collections https://plus.google.com/collections/welcome  
A devilishly simple way to group your posts by topic.

When you create a Collection you set the audience, so you can have private collections for posts on a topic to share with a particular audience, or you can have public collections that anyone can follow.

This is a brilliant move on Google&#8217;s part. Users can follow topic from a user, rather than every little thing they posts. It&#8217;s so simple to share with a collection too, so it&#8217;s a win for those posting the content.

Another win is that posts by content are so reader friendly that the take up on followers is very good.

Google+ is becoming my favourite place to post stuff to now, and a great place for a Global community instead of just posting stuff amongst your friends and family. The Internet is the world, not just the people you already know.

I hope more and more of you come round to Google+, and if you don&#8217;t, well you&#8217;ll be missing out but you won&#8217;t be missed, there&#8217;s a whole world of people out there.
