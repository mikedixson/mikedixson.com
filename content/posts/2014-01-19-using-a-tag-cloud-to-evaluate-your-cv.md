After seeing this [LifeHacker article][1] I popped the text from my CV into[Â http://tagcrowd.com/][2] to see how my CV shaped up.

As I&#8217;m looking to move into management for such roles as Network Manager I&#8217;m quite pleased at how this tag cloud shapes up.

I definitely suggest that every gives this a go.
