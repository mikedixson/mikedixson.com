Like many people it seems I&#8217;ve been scratching my head as to whyÂ  WDS&#8217;s Driver Package Filters were not matching my hardware when imaging a machine that I&#8217;d created a driver package group for.

After looking at [Greg Shields technet post][1] I was convinced I just needed to grab the model name straight off of the machine type beforehand via a powershell WMI get and I&#8217;d be laughing. Alas this still did not work.

I found the best way was to enable the Debug log on WDS, then pull the info directly from what WDS was seeing and use that to create the filters.  
I&#8217;ve also written a powershell script to pull the details from the debug log as otherwise it takes a fair bit of time.  
I&#8217;ve posted this here:
