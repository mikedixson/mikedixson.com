So when using the Frozen Plains Obelisk plugin in Ableton live 10 (I&#8217;m running10.1.15) following Frozen Plains instructions doesn&#8217;t work.  
If you change the 2nd drop down on the synth/instrument track to Obelisk64 instead of Pre FX then it will work.

Additionally, if you don&#8217;t want record a whole extra midi track for the Obelisk track then instead of arming both track, just set to Obelisk track to In on the monitoring and then arm the instrument you want to record. This has the added benefit of being able to easily have multiple instruments using Obelisk and switch to record on whichever one you want to play<figure class="wp-block-image">
