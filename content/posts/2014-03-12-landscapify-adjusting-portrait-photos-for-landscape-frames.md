I&#8217;ve been making a lot more use of my digital photo frame since I moved into my flat but a fair few of the photos I want to make use of are portrait orientation whilst the majority are landscape.

For a load of photos I&#8217;ve gone thru them and manually made them landscape by using a method I noticed that You&#8217;ve Been Framed use when viewers send in mobile footage shot in the wrong orientation for tv. The technique is to enlarge a second copy of the image/video as a background layer to fit the width of the landscape orientation and blur the background.

I figured as I&#8217;d want to do this to a lot of images over time I&#8217;d make a script to do so. So using Photoshop&#8217;s Actions I&#8217;ve done so and thought I&#8217;d share it:Â [Landscapify &#8211; Mike Dixson.atn][1]Â Here&#8217;s how to load the actions into your PhotoshopÂ <a href="http://www.imphotography.com/downloads/installactions.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://www.imphotography.com/downloads/installactions.htm</a>[
