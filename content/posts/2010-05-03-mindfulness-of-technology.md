<a href="http://www.twitter.com/tinybuddha" target="_blank" rel="noopener">www.twitter.com/tinybuddha</a>&#8216;s post <a href="http://bit.ly/dwYuNh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://bit.ly/dwYuNh</a> I&#8217;m inspired to think 2 things:

  1. There is no digital replacement for a hug. So hug someone.
  2. You can use the batteries in your life to regulate some good habits. For instance. If your mobile&#8217;s battery is running low at the end of the day, think you&#8217;ve done at least as much work and so should do something positive. Meditate, switch off, recharge by sleeping. You could also pull the power from your laptop and use the battery life of your laptop to regulate you taking a breaking. Stash your charger in a drawer so you can&#8217;t just whack it on charge quickly.
