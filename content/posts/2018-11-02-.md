  When enabling Modern Authentication access to Office 365 Exchange a POP or EWS connection is made from your intranet to the Office 365 Cloud which then makes a call back to your ADFS as a third leg authentication.<br />If you have MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) enabled then this will fail as the O365 Cloud doesn&#8217;t represent that MFA back to the client.
