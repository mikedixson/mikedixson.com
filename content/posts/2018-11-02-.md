<p class="has-drop-cap">
  When enabling Modern Authentication access to Office 365 Exchange a POP or EWS connection is made from your intranet to the Office 365 Cloud which then makes a call back to your ADFS as a third leg authentication.<br />If you have MFA (Multi Factor Authentication) enabled then this will fail as the O365 Cloud doesn&#8217;t represent that MFA back to the client.

The fix is to create an Account Control Policy to allow a group of accounts to bypass MFA, however the Access Control Policy logicÂ is little counter intuitive. A call to MS Support ended up resulting in the following Policy.
