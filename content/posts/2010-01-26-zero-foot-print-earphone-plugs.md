In this crazy world where you can buy a 64GB usb drive that is little bigger than the <a href="http://www.markstechnologynews.com/2008/11/buffalo-japan-launches-tiny-microsd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USB plug</a> itself how comes ear phones still have a zonking great big plug on them.

What we need for our iPod/iPhone and other PMPs is a zero (or near enough) foot print earphone plug.  
If the cable was strengthened near the socket than that could be used to pull the plug out, eliminating the bulky plug entirely.
