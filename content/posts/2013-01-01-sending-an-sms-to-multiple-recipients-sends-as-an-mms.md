# Happy New Year SMS not MMS

Sending out a few new years eve sms message I found that if I added more than one recipient my SMS became an MMS  
A little looking around on New Years Day and I found this setting was checked by default on my Nexus 4 with ICS

# Changing Android Multiple Recipients to SMS

**Unchecking Group Messaging** fixes this issue.  
Hope that helps some of you out there.
