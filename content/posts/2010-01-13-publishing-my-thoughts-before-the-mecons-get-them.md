As someone who is naturally very creative and also naturally very lazy I&#8217;ve always been one to have bright ideas but not to put them into action.

It&#8217;s come to my attention lately that my ideas are becoming predictions and several of my ideas have crept into the real world without my participation. Now I&#8217;m by no means saying that pixies are coming and stealing my thoughts in the night but I wanted to make my ideas sort of open source. An open source idea would be one that anyone could act on but that I would be credited for coming up with the initial idea, no financial motives here, just pure ego.

The following posts will detail an idea of mine as thoroughly as I can.
