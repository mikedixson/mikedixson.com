Newspaper publishers are finally coming to terms with new media and trying to work out where there business model lies in this new landscape.

However it occurred to me that they&#8217;ve missed a very basic thing in the current transition to new media.  
All newspapers that are currently working with charging models are all using a subscription based service.  
As someone who had a few paper rounds in their youth I know that there are far more houses I&#8217;d cycle by than deliver too. I also don&#8217;t know anyone at work who get&#8217;s a regular paper on their way in.  
I&#8217;ve been enjoying the Guardian&#8217;s iPhone app. I&#8217;d never read the guardian before but actually got some semi-regular use out of the app, particularly as I could just read those sections and contributor&#8217;s columns that I enjoyed. However now they&#8217;ve introduced a new app with a charging model. The price is very reasonable at Â£3 per month and comes with a few new features over the old app. However it&#8217;s still a subscription model. For occasional newspaper readers like myself and everyone I know at work a subscription isn&#8217;t what they are after.  
And so I got to thinking how comes Newspaper publishers, who were so fearful of change, have moved to a model where you can&#8217;t replicate the real world activity of being able to buy just one news paper.  
Even if this translates to paying a one off fee for a period of access those people who don&#8217;t want to sign up to a recurring subscription don&#8217;t seem to be being catered for and are a missed business opportunity.

I hope that Newspaper publishers redress this oversight and allow the occasional buyers access and themselves to get the extra revenue to realise new media is not a threat, it&#8217;s an opportunity.
