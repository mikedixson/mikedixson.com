My brother <a title="Greg Dixson" href="http://gregdixson.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Greg Dixson</a> has been learning **a lot** about web design recently. Including how to reskin WordPress.  
He&#8217;s made impressive leaps and with just two words has opened a new world to me.  _<a title="Word Press Child Themes" href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Child_Themes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Child Themes</a> _are those two words.

With Word presses child themes you can take an existing theme and hack around with it, confident that the next update from the author of that theme isn&#8217;t going to blow away all your hard work.  
So right now you are looking at my first child theme. There&#8217;s not too much tweaking so far. But this has opened me up to redesigning my site(s) again.  
I&#8217;ll make no promises about this getting done, as web design for my own pleasure get&#8217;s done in fits and starts. But hopefully this site&#8217;s style will start to grow over time.
