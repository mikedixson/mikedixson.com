Most people would say money burns a hole in my pocket, that&#8217;s not entirely true, I&#8217;m not as frugal as some, but I enjoy the money I do have and have enough to get buy on.

**But**, I&#8217;m trying to save to buy a property and so every penny counts. Changing your spending habits takes discipline and saving as much as I need to in the time that I want to takes a lot of saving, thus a lot of discipline.  
So I&#8217;ve been trying out self imposed poverty.

As with most of you, in the last week of a month I&#8217;m pretty poor, and start spending more frugally, watching what I spend more, making the cheaper choices and so on. So what if I move the poverty line? What if I shift the date when the pinch hits forward to midway through the month?  
So the last couple of months after I get paid and my regular transfer to my savings occurs, I transfered an extra £100 to my savings.

So now I&#8217;m poorer sooner, but start spending more frugally sooner. Even if I need grab that money back towards the end of the month I&#8217;m not dipping into my regular savings, and I&#8217;ve already started spending more frugally by then anyway, so will have still made some in roads to spending less that month than I otherwise would have.

So what do you reckon? Think you can try and impose some poverty on yourself for your own greater good?
