As someone who works in IT I don&#8217;t find the need to print very much nowadays, mostly just for some procedural things at work. So on a monthly basis I have the experience of selecting a bunch of files in Finder, right clicking and then wondering why the hell something as user friendly as a Mac not have a Print selected files context menu. So finally I bothered to find out how to do it, it&#8217;s so simple that I&#8217;ve no idea why Apple didn&#8217;t just include it.

  1. Open Automator
  2. From the menu of what type of document you want to make select **Service**
  3. Configure the options as below (click to enlarge):[<img loading="lazy" class="alignnone wp-image-515 size-full" src="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/print-selected-items.png" alt="print selected items" width="1044" height="674" srcset="/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/print-selected-items.png 1044w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/print-selected-items-300x194.png 300w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/print-selected-items-1024x661.png 1024w, /wp-content/uploads/2015/01/print-selected-items-768x496.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 1044px) 100vw, 1044px" />][1]
  4. Save with the name you want to see the item listed as in the right click menu i.e. **Print Selected Items**

[Update] A Mac expert that I know has informed me you can always select the files and then hit **command + p**
