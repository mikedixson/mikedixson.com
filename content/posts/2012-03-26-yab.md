Hi all,

Well my personal home page has been something of a holding page for over a year now. A sort of Internet business card to point people to all the other places they can reach me.

I have a couple of blogs, I don&#8217;t post that frequently and they barely make a blip on the Internet, but I keep plodding away with them none the less. But they have a specific purpose. They are not me, about me, things I&#8217;ve been up to or anything like that. They are very specific.

So I&#8217;ve decided to take the plunge with using my Mike Dixson domain as a place to collate my public persona blogging. So here you might see personal blog posts, photo posts, links I want to share. Using www.ifttt.com I should be able to nicely pull content into here from other sources and colour it somewhat with more personal blog posts. Hopefully they&#8217;ll be of some use to someone. Who knows!!

Anyway, I&#8217;m still ironing out the kinks at the change in design so I&#8217;ll continue to crack on with that. For now please take a look at my About page and the social networking links at the bottom of the page.

Thanks  
Mike
