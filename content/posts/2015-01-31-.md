Every now and again web design needs a bit of a reboot. Trends and technology shape what is desirable and possible iteratively over time and every so often it get&#8217;s to a bit of a weird place and needs a reboot.

Case in point, Gizmodo.co.uk, Lifehacker.co.uk and Boredpanda.com they all suffer with the same issue from my point of view. The wrong shape. I&#8217;ll demonstrate&#8230;.
