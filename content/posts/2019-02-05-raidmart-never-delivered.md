Please be extremely wary of the company&nbsp;https://www.raidmart.com/  
My experience with them has been that I ordered a item from them, the money was taken immediately. Emails were sent confirming the item had been dispatched with a tracking link.

And that is ALL that ever happened. The item never arrived. The tracking link remains with the status &#8220;We&#8217;ve accepted your order, and we&#8217;re getting it ready. Come back to this page for updates on your shipment status.&#8221;  
I&#8217;ve contacted the company numerous times, with no reply. I&#8217;ve followed their refund procedure, with no reply.

From my experience I believe this site is a scam.
