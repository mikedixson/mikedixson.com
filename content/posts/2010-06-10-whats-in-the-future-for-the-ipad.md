At best I can only see I&#8217;ll use it as a portable web reader for reading web documents away from my desk.  
For instance the other day I had a couple of web documents that I needed to get my head around so I printed them both and went off somewhere quiet to get into the documents. However, any decent eReader can provide a similar function, though admitedly I&#8217;d need to print to PDF the docs and load them to the eReader.

Either way an iPad seems a bit of over kill for that. Maybe the apps that come to the iPad will make it more essential.  
For now I&#8217;ll stick with my iPhone to fill the app gap.
