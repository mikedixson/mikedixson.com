I learnt this today, & thought it best to share it with all to help you avoid getting a parking ticket or your car towed as was experienced by my friend today:

> &#8220;Single yellows indicate a restriction that applies for any period less than 24 hours. A time plate is needed to show the times of control unless the restriction is in a CPZ and the hours of operation coincide with the CPZ operating times.&#8221;

-Taken from [Tower Hamlet&#8217;s Parking Policy][1].

For instance, the road near me has resident parking Monday &#8211; Friday 8:30am &#8211; 5:30pm. Whilst this is very clearly marked on the side of the road with the restriction the other side has no signage at all, just a single yellow line.

Be aware of the above and hopefully we can stop this ridiculous psuedo tax on parking in London!

Share this with everyone you know please.
