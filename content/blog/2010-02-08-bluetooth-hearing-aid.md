A colleague of mine, Dan Shane, suggested to me today a good topic to post on my site would be bluetooth hearing aids.  
A quick Google around shows that someone beat him too the idea first [for example][1]

There&#8217;s also a walk through of how to make your own: <a title="make your own bluetooth hearing aid walk through" href="http://gfern.com/btha/btha.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">http://gfern.com/btha/btha.html</a>

It&#8217;s certainly a great idea. If/when I lose my hearing and have to have a hearing aid then why not make it a bluetooth one that I can connect to my iphone, ipod, tv and any other audio devices that I have in the house so that I can just have the sound straight into my ear rather than making them loud enough for the hearing aid to pick up and amplify.
