This is a half formed thought so far but I&#8217;m banging it up here anyway. Can we make washing machines that detect if there&#8217;s something in your pockets?  
All clothes come down to a few basic materials, so if you could eliminate those materials anything else left must be a foreign body that perhaps shouldn&#8217;t be in the washing machine and the user alerted.
