After banging my head against this problem from a different server, as WSL is not there yet for running as personal production services, I finally managed to hit the right keywords to google fu the answer. php-smbclient has been dropped from the officially repositories and so can only be installed via a PPA.

Installing using the following commands finally sorted it for me, credit to Markus (linked below for this solution)

<pre class="wp-block-code"><code>echo "deb http://ppa.launchpad.net/ondrej/php/ubuntu $(lsb_release -cs) main" | tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/php.list
apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com:443 4F4EA0AAE5267A6C        
apt-get update && apt-get install php-smbclient
phpenmod smbclient
service apache2 restart </code></pre>
