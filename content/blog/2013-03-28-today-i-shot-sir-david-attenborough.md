      So I&#8217;ve been very lucky today. Part of Ravensbourne&#8217;s remit at the moment is both to teach 3D and to run events. The 3D Creative Summit, held at the BFI, make for a nice dovetailing of these interests.<br /> Lucky for me I was able to grab some photos on behalf of Ravensbourne over the last two days, including shots of Sir David Attenborough as he gave a Q&A session revolving around 3D and his recent Galapagos Island showcase.

      After shooting a lot of panels over the last two days I was keenly watching for any gesticulation that differentiated one shot from another. Which resulted in the following photo.
