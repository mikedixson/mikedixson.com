  Android was more helpful and told me that the battery level was too low.
  
  Plugging the device in I was able to flash the device straight away and bring my Xoom back to life and make use of an old tablet again!

When trying to flash my old Motorola Xoom using this excellent guide <http://www.xda-developers.com/motorola-xoom-still-alive-and-kicking-receives-functional-kitkat/> I was unable to flash the system and google apps zips from TWRP and received the following error:

`Updating partition details...<br />
Unable to open zip file.<br />
Error flashing zip '/sdcard/update.zip`

The error wasn&#8217;t quite verbose enough. I found when I tried to have another stab at flashing the recovery partition Android was more helpful and told me that the **battery level was too low**.
