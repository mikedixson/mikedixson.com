It&#8217;s occurred to me that it doesn&#8217;t matter how many photos you see of a prospective Internet date you see the reality on date night can often be a very different one indeed.

Whilst reading about some 3D printing technology recently I thought that a possible next step for Internet Dating could be for dating websites to require a front and profile shot uploaded and they could then render a 3D model on the website for prospective partners to view. Going one step further you could make a 3D print of the face, maybe at designated 3D print house which are spreading rapidly, the prospective partner could then get a real sense of the person before meeting them and avoid any awkward first dates.

Alternatively it could just be really creepy to print off strangers faces.
