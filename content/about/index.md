### Work

I work as an Infrastructure Engineer for an AdTech company.

#### Personal

I sing and play guitar both in my band under my own name and also under the name Mike BTW.

Interested in design, psychology, sociology and the future of technology within people&#8217;s lives.

I'm passionate about photography some examples of my photos can be found on my <a title="Mike Dixson's Flickr Feed" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mikedixson" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Flickr feed</a>..  
As well as in my [Published Photos][1] page

I produce a cygwin based OpenSSH Server for Windows (with client tools too) at [http://sshwindows.webheat.co.uk][2] this tool has been referenced in VMWare admin [documentation produced by VMWare][3].

I've also appeared in the MacCleans TV ident after being approached quite randomly at an ice rink for my birthday one year.
