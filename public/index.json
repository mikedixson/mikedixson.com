[{"categories":["Artificial Intelligence","Everyday AI","IT","Machine Learning","Technology"],"contents":"Summary As an IT engineer I\u0026rsquo;m often on the cutting edge of technology and constantly trying to stay ahead of new technology so that I can make informed strategic decisions. With the massive rise of \u0026ldquo;Artificial Intelligence\u0026rdquo; and Machine Learning there\u0026rsquo;s been an awful lot to test and assess, including what usefulness can it actually provide.\nWhere I Use ML aka AI Image Generation As someone who produces art, design, and photography products for hobbies, I am very aware of the concerns within the artistic community regarding the use of generative AI to create images. I have experimented with tools like Stable Diffusion, Dall-E 3, and Midjourney to explore how prompts can shape the output. It is an interesting tool, but the fact that it builds upon the work of artists who have dedicated their lives to studying art, subverting forms, and bringing innovation raises ethical questions. I don\u0026rsquo;t have any definitive answers for this ongoing debate.\nThat being said, I do utilize image generation as a practical tool. My most frequent use of image generation is to create header images for Sharepoint pages that I create at work for documentation purposes. I strive to document regularly, and therefore, I have a pre-saved prompt starter that I simply need to add a topic to, and I can obtain a consistently themed image from Copilot, powered by Dall-E 3.\nCode Generation I work in Terraform code daily at the moment as two new projects use Terraform as the IaC tool. Since doing so I\u0026rsquo;ve needed a proper IDE instead of working on PowerShell, Bash and Batch files in PowerShell ISE, Nano or Notepad. As it was trending so hard and \u0026lsquo;free\u0026rsquo; I went for VSCode. The Terraform and Gitlab extensions made it easy to get up and running with.\nI didn\u0026rsquo;t jump on the Gitlab CoPilot bandwagon right away, but the fact that it was potentially available in so many parts of VSCode got me curious, and for aroud £100 per year I thought it was worth a punt. Within a couple of days I definitely had got my £100s worth!\nThere are 3 main ways I use Github CoPilot in my workflow\nGit Commit Messages It\u0026rsquo;s a small thing but I\u0026rsquo;m very much a commit often person. I work between two different machines so Gitlab is also my method of making sure I\u0026rsquo;m in sync on both locations. Github CoPilot\u0026rsquo;s ability to appriase the changes and summarize with a commit message is super handy and in the last month or two have even improved massively.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s not always spot on, sometimes if there are a couple of changes within the code it might favour, what I\u0026rsquo;d consider, a smaller change over the more functional change. Say a commented out code removal over a change of a Terraform resource name.\nCreating Code Auto Code Complete Once I had Github CoPilot installed/enabled this took the Terraform auto code complete from 0 to 60. This was a big improvement and meant that the auto code complete was, largley, instantly usable.\nThe downside of this was that I could quickly generate code with errors too, and more code means more errors to troubleshoot.\nAdditionally, when the code was generated for you, you\u0026rsquo;re not as consciously familiar with the code, and so when an error comes up, you don\u0026rsquo;t necessarily know the area of code that might have caused the error. If the code itself is the error this is fine, maybe something syntactically or such. But when a reference being parsed in is causing an error in the later resource you have to start tracing the error without an naturally insight into the chain of code.\nCode from Prompt The second way I use Github CoPilot is to use either the prompt (via ctrl+i) or in the Chat extension and create a well formed prompt to create the resource(s) that I need. For instance \u0026ldquo;Create the resources for a S3 bucket hosting a website on https://mikedixson.com, favour using modules over individual resources\u0026rdquo;\nCode Troubleshooting Github CoPilot having access to the full code, and not just the blob you can paste into a chat boxes maximum character count gives it a big advantage over just using a chatgpt-a-like.\nThis enables troubleshooting across areas of code that you might not hav initially thought to be the issue, but also, the solutuons provided might be alternate methods of implementation to the route you\u0026rsquo;d gone down so can provide a different perspective.\nDown Sides of AI Code Creation Along with amount of code that is generated and the troubleshooting issues that provides the is still a non-zero chance that the generate code will be bad code.\nThe autocompleted bucket_id when referencing the output of a bucket module, which should be s3_bucket_id is a consistent pain in the rear, with no way for me to retrain the model out of this.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s also been times when a Terraform resource type or function will be halucinated. terraform fmt and validate pick these up, but if you\u0026rsquo;ve been working for ages on writing some code centered around some functionality that doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist that can be an annoying pill to swallow.\nMeta Search Web search is broken, is gamified and corrupted by advertising trying to lure you to their site over others by using money instead of the best content.\nUsing CoPilot as my \u0026ldquo;search engine\u0026rdquo; means that I get the literal answer* rather than a website laden with adverts, conversational prose, incorrect answers to come thru.\nA good example of this is recipe blogs. It\u0026rsquo;s lovely that you\u0026rsquo;ve posted your life story with a recipe, but I\u0026rsquo;m literally trying to cook dinner right now and I just need the ingredients and the instructions.\n*Answer might be a strong word as AI is not beyond giving incorrect answers.\nPrompt Tips When using a general generative AI like CoPilot, ChatGTP etc. I often front load the context. So if I\u0026rsquo;m asking an AWS specific question I might start with \u0026ldquo;Answer an an AWS export\u0026hellip;..\u0026rdquo;\nI occassionally use tricks I\u0026rsquo;ve seen online that I\u0026rsquo;ve found to yield good results like \u0026ldquo;Take a deep breath and \u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo;\nOne of the most useful prompt techniques I\u0026rsquo;ve found is to give the model a chance to clarify.\nFor example \u0026ldquo;Answer as an aws expert. What is the optimal way to set up a new VPC for ECS containers to run in at large scale. Ask up to 3 questions to clarify\u0026rdquo;\nThis approach often gives better answers but also, some of the questions asked back can be things you may not have thought about.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/posts/everyday-ai-ml-artificial-intelligence-machine-learning/","tags":["Artificial Intelligence","AWS","Code Generation","Code Troubleshooting","Everyday AI","Image Generation","IT","Machine Learning","Meta Search","Prompt Techniques"],"title":"Everyday AI in IT"},{"categories":["Tech Solutions"],"contents":"After much trawling of the Internet I found an interesting take on the pain of moving a Sharepoint page from one site to another, using Power Automate.\nThe solution that RobElliot had posted contained a few manual steps, and knowing colleagues and I had all done this more than once I refined his solution a bit.\nStarting with a PowerApps V2 component enables us to capture input from the user for the soure page and destination site.

I’ve since made a point of filling my evenings with live music and here’s how I achieve it.\nAutomatically Find Gigs I scrobble all the tracks I listen to, from my phone, my home stereo system, everything, to Last.fm http://www.last.fm/user/mikedixson\nThis means that my Last.fm data is a pretty complete picture of my musical tastes.\nI use the Songkick application on my smartphone to scan my Last.fm profile for artists to track. Song kick then keeps an eye out for gigs posted by artists I like and alerts me on my phone when a new gig is posted.\nI’ve also got BandsInTown installed, but this doesn’t seem to let me know about as many gigs as Songkick does.\nMoney’s not a problem If I hear about a gig within the first couple of weeks after pay day I’ll usually just book the ticket. But towards the end of the month, like most of you, money’s a little tighter. So what I do is whenever I see a gig that I want to go to I set myself a reminder using Google Now or Google Keep to go off on my next pay day.\nThat way, come pay day I buy a load of tickets to gigs and set up my coming months.\nSize might be everything I like a lot of small bands that I’ve discovered by going to small/medium size festivals and listening to less mainstream radio like BBC 6 Music.\nAs a result a lot of the tickets I buy are between £5-£15 a ticket. Much better than shelling out £60-£100 on one gig.\nTicket to ride A lot of my tickets nowadays are bought thru the Dice app or thru Songkick themselves.\nBoth of these resellers allow for digital only tickets and no fees!\nThis keep the price down, and saves me having to hunt around in ‘safe places’ for tickets for gigs that I’ve booked 6 months ago.\nDice app also has a pretty nice interface to just go scrolling thru looking for other gigs that you might not have otherwise known about and then buy tickets for them too.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/how-i-coloured-my-life-with-live-music/","tags":["dice","gig","gigs","last.fm","lifehack","lifehacks","live","music","songkick"],"title":"How I Coloured My Life with Live Music"},{"categories":["Microsoft","Tech Solutions","Windows"],"contents":"The below PowerShell script check the website is responding AND doesn’t returns a certain string, if either test is failed then a Windows service is restarted, forcefully if necessary after a grace period.\nPlease note that I have modified this script to make it more easily customisable and not had the opportunity to test with the strings switched out for the variables.

I’m still using my Xbox 360 presently.\nThe reason I don’t own one yet is down to a couple of factors… I just bought a flat so money is tiiiiiiight. As such I’m waiting for pay rises and price drops to reach a point where I can afford to have one skint month and splash out on the Xbox One.\nThe other contributing factor is that I’m holding on till the TV system’s kinks have been worked out for the UK as once I have the XBox One I’d like to be using it’s TV integration all the time.\nThat being said I still have very strong views on why the Xbox One should always be sold with the Kinect.\nWhat makes the Kinect great The new Kinect is incredibly powerful and capable. It can tell your heart rate, facial expression, weight distribution across your limbs. That is an amazing feat along with it’s video and skeletal tracking.\nIt can also do all of this across a much wide range of lighting set ups than the previous version.\nWhere some users seem to be failing to see the potential though is that they are thinking about the current paradigm of maybe using a kinect with a dance game, or playing a kinect game like Kinect Adventures or such where the activity has been designed to change the gaming experience to one of physical participation.\nThinking outside the XBox However if you think outside the box for a moment and imagine you’re playing a HD graphics zombie game. As you play the game it guages your heart rate and notices you are particularly exhilarated by a certain type of zombie or situation. It tweaks it’s algorithms and so you are taken thru more, similar situations. The game has become personalised to you, and the experience has become augmented by playing off you as an individual.\nYou could also imagine a game scenario where every time die at a certain stage of a game the kinect notices your unhappy face and body position, after a tailored amount of times the game makes that section easier to allow you to proceed. Suddenly a game you might have given up on and traded in you are now playing in it’s entirety.\nThere are a million different scenarios where using the many sensors in the Kinect the gaming experience can be uniquely tailored. However in order for games manufacturers finding this a worthwhile enough venture to invest time and money in they need to know that the audience is there.\nIf they know that everyone with console X definitely have the sensors they need, they know there is a market worth investing in.\nIf their efforts are going to be wasted on users without a Kinect then why bother.\nAs a result of this dichotomy the result will be games that are Better with Kinect and have features gludged on to make this so.\nHe’s the (not) Greatest Dancer Yes you might be a hardcore gamer who plays FPS and what would you need a Kinect for, you’re not going to be dancing in your living room, you’re going to be maming, but what if the number of enemies that the game threw at you depended on how fast your heart was beating. What if your presence not being detected in a game depended on keeping your heart rate calm and steady and not moving a muscle?\nOpen your mind ","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/why-the-xbox-one-being-sold-without-the-kinect-is-a-bad-thing/","tags":["gaming","kinect","one","xbone","xbox","xbox one"],"title":"Why the XBox One Being Sold Without The Kinect Is a Bad Thing"},{"categories":["Photography","Tech Solutions","Technology","Tips"],"contents":"I’ve been making a lot more use of my digital photo frame since I moved into my flat but a fair few of the photos I want to make use of are portrait orientation whilst the majority are landscape.\nFor a load of photos I’ve gone thru them and manually made them landscape by using a method I noticed that You’ve Been Framed use when viewers send in mobile footage shot in the wrong orientation for tv.

When setting a lyric challenge having a goal is the key. If you’ve got no reason to write a song you won’t get a word written down.\nOften the reason is heartbreak or sitting there bored with your guitar in hand and happening upon something to explore. Setting a goal with a song challenge is a more proactive way of writing songs.\nOnce you have a goal you have something to work towards, whether it’s write one song by the end of the day, or write a song a day.\nA Creative Goal The next thing is to have a goal that inspires some interesting creative angles. It’s very easy to become stale in musical style and lyrical theme, something to put your outside your comfort zone, but also something to make you take different approaches to those you’d would normally take.\nFor instance, a title for a song normally doesn’t come to mind till you’ve written a song. Start with a handful of titles, pick one and and explore what it could mean.\n“See you on the other side of goodbye” – Could be about the end of a relationship, or it could be about what happens after a relationship has ended and lovers want to remain friends. Or it could be about someone dying and the morning process.\nYour Starter For 10 Ok so there’s a few suggestions for lyrical challenges to get your started\nTitle Ideas http://www.lyricideas.com/ – Lists 10 potential song titles (and lyrics) per day Write a Reply – Find a favourite song and write a reply song A novel idea – Try and capture the main theme of a favourite character in a novel in a song 5 Minute Rush – A great way to quiet your inner critic set a timer and write as much of a song as you can in 5 minutes. Change Position – If you’re songs are normally written in the first person, or normally from a narrator’s point of view then switch it up. Force yourself to use another perspective. One a Day – Similar to some bloggers, taking a 30 day challenge of a song. Write one song a day for 30 days. It doesn’t have to be a good song. But the act of writing every day will encourage your brain to generate more lyrics all the time and doing anything for 30 days in a row is a great way of starting to form a habit. Take Advantage Of Your Little Thoughts Whilst this doesn’t quite fit in as a challenge, I implore every lyricist to buy some of these soft pocket notebooks and carrying one of these very pocketable pens and take them absolutely everywhere with you! The times when I’ve written the most lyrics are the times when I’m most idea and my brain has time to wander.\nI might have a few minutes on a bus or a tube and my mind idly wanders through one thought or another, maybe driven by what I see in front of me, or maybe I’m lost in my own mind. But then BAM! I’m hit but a beautiful turn of phrase or way of perceiving something that I’d not thought of before.\nIf I can capture that right there and then I have a chance of working it into a song.\nOtherwise it’s gone forever!\nI’ve tried to mimic this spontaneous note taking using my ever-present smart phone instead. However there’s something so unforgiving about typing text into a phone that means I lose the meaning almost as much as if I’d never written it down at all.\nGood luck with your lyric writing!\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/lyrical-challenges-tips-to-write-song-lyrics/","tags":["challenges","games","lyrics","songs"],"title":"Lyrical Challenges – Tips To Write Song Lyrics"},{"categories":["Security","Technology"],"contents":"In order to activate an IOS device when behind a firewall allow the following traffic\nhttps 17.149.240.70 nwk-unbrick2.apple.com","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/activating-an-iphone-or-ipad-through-a-firewall/","tags":["apple","firewall","security"],"title":"Activating an iPhone or iPad Through a Firewall"},{"categories":["Security","Tech Solutions","Technology"],"contents":"If you allow port 80 and 443 access out of your network then accessing the Apple App Store from behind your firewall it’s a doddle.\nHowever if you have a more locked down area of a network but have iPads etc that need App Store access here’s what you need to allow port 80 and 443 access to:\n17.154.0.0/16 Apple's Class B Subnet includes phobos.apple.com address(es) 23.63.98.0/23 Akamai Technologies CDN I appreciate this is a bit of a wide range of addresses, but unless you want to be having to packet capture and analyze where the App store is heading too that week it’s a reasonable.

I want to lose weight and keep it off, and that can’t happen if I’m changing my lifestyle so significantly that it’s not my usual lifestyle. That being said of course changes have to be made otherwise I’d stay the same weight or gain weight.\nOne Calorie, Two Calorie, Three Calorie, Four So the modification I’ve gone for is Calorie counting. At the end of the day if you are putting more Calories in than you are burning then you are going to put on weight. It’s that simple.\nSo with some calculations of my Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR) and using the Harris Benedict Equation to multiply based on my activity level I now have a daily Calorie goal of 1780 Calories.\nI’ve been working to this for about 6 weeks now and have gone from 14 Stone (90Kilos) to 13.5 Stone(85Kilos).\nI bought a new belt not long after starting Calorie counting and I was just about on the holes for the large one. Now I’m on the lowest hole of the belt. I wish I’d taken more measurements to keep track of the physical representation of the weight coming off. I did take some photos so they’ll give some idea.\nMaking those Calories count My goal is to get down to 11 Stone (70 Kilos). So I’m a quarter of the way there.\nIt’s not really taken a massive effort on my part. I gave up drinking cola at the beginning of the year anyway, so that’s made things easier other each bottle is the calorific equivalent of a decent snack wasted.\nCounting calories has made me more aware of where the calories were creeping up on me. I no longer eat crisps with a sandwich, or have a side of chips with a hot sandwich in the local pub. The latter nearly doubles the Calories of the meal.\nIf I’m going to have a snack I want to calories to really count.

I just wanted to summarise the facts here and back that up with sources.\nNote: I am an Xbox 360 owner. I also own a PSP and PSVita. I endeavor to write as factually and unbiased as I can.\nKinect2 Always On – Is Microsoft Watching Me?? If you think that Microsoft have got the resources to actively be watching you all the time then go and speak to your doctor about your paranoia.\nMicrosoft have stated that the Kinect2 has a number of different power level modes, the lowest of which is just listening for you to say Xbox On. A feature you can turn off if you are struck by paranoia.\nIf you have a Kinect 1 then when your Xbox is on the Kinect is on so no change there.\nSource: http://kotaku.com/xbox-ones-kinect-can-turn-off-microsoft-says-noting-510100564\nAside: Those who are worrying about the people in the room being counted and watchers of a video being limited http://tinyurl.com/asxchtd, I think this has several possibilities.\nFirstly, it could be used to change on a more granular basis for media licensing, i.e. if just one person is watching then you get charged a cheaper rate. If another person enters, of course the rate would need to step up, and so could do so, up to a family license.\nThe other thing that would be interesting is if you could opt in to a tv viewer survey. Presently tv ratings are worked out based on a small number of people having a special set top box type device that users then have to tap in who’s watching every hour or so.\nThe figures would be much more demonstrative if they taken from real world counts of people watching. An opt in policy should apply of course.\nAlways Online – But what if I have no Internet?? There are two issues people have about this. Firstly that it’s calling back to home to check your right to play your games, and secondly people seem to be worrying about having a connection all the time.\nThe Xbox One checks once every 24 hours if you have the right to play your games. This does seem a bit off at first glance I agree. But the Xbox One is bringing with it a load of shifting paradigms, and they are going to take some getting used to.\nFor instance, I can insert a disc that I’ve bought, and ‘install’ it and then play it whenever I like, and even round friend’s houses without the disk. The online check has replaced the checking the ownership of the physical disc.\nI can also lend my games to up to ten ‘family’ members who can be in different geographical locations and don’t need to be blood relatives, so think of family as a very very lose term here. I can also play simultaneously with one of my ‘family’ members even though they don’t own the game. That’s a very useful and cool function. A lot of gamers I know have a close group of gaming friends. Worked right they could save on buying games between them and could enjoy playing together on games that one or more of them might not usually buy.\nIf you are worried about what if you’re internet connection goes down, when was the last time your internet went down?\nIf you’re worried because you don’t want your Xbox to be online all the time. What do you think is happening with your current console? Are you disabling the internet when you don’t want it online? We live in a connected world, you’re reading this on the Internet.\nSource: http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/license\nDRM roll please – I want to trade in *MY* games I’ve heard a number of approaches to explain this, but to me this is again another paradigm shift that is going to be hard for people to swallow initially.\nThink about when Apple started releasing computers without floppy drives, and more recently, without cd/dvd drives.\nDisc are going the way of the Dodo, and the floppy before them, and we’ll be fine with that in time. Microsoft haven’t taken the bolder and scarier decision of getting shot of disc entirely. But the disc has become less important. It’s a token of your purchase of the game. As mentioned above, once installed you no longer need the disc in your machine.\nHowever this move forward to a discless system hasn’t been the focus due to the DRM discussions and rants going on online.\nLet’s lay out the actual facts of the policy:\nPublishers (not Microsoft) will chose whether to allow trade ins on their games You can gift a game to a friend. (a game can only be gifted once) Source: http://news.xbox.com/2013/06/license\nAt least one analyst has suggested that all published will enable trade ins to avoid complaints.\nSource: http://www.videogamer.com/news/all_publishers_will_enable_trade-ins_and_pre-owned_gaming_on_xbox_one_says_pachter.html\nLet’s also consider the alternative. Sony had a laugh poking fun at Microsoft’s DRM policy. However their own DRM policy doesn’t seem all that different. Publisher’s have the ability to enable DRM and to what degree. The key difference seems to be that Microsoft game publisher’s can limit traded games.\nIf you find that they do… maybe you take that up with them by boycotting their games. They’ll soon change their tune.\nSource: http://www.polygon.com/2013/6/11/4419476/playstation-4-third-party-publishers-can-dictate-their-own-drm-terms\nFinally The Price – ooh the PS4 is cheaper And? Yes, the PS4 is cheaper. The PS4 also doesn’t include a ground breaking new Kinect 2 which can detect your heart rate and facial expressions of users.\nYou’re not comparing like for like, so why compare the price?\nIf you want an Xbox One and the price is good enough for you, then buy one.

So no one need be the owner of the object as if I have one and you want one we can just print another.\nAs this technology continues to allow more complex printing and other media becomes digitally encoded versions of itself why feel the burden of possession.\nI read an interesting article once about road rage which statement that the reason we feel angry when someone overtakes and pulls in front of us is because to our minds that bit of road in front of us was ours, our possession.

Two things have occurred to me of late.\nWhilst making a request for a referral at the doctors I was told my present address was outside of the catchment area of my doctors, whom I’d registered with whilst at my previous place.\nI could still make it to that doctor’s surgery just fine and didn’t cause them to run late by getting there late every time due to some arduous journey. So it was a bit irksome.\nFurther more I knew I was due to move in less than three months and I didn’t know where to, so any attempt to register at a new doctor’s surgery would be equally as invalid.\nI am not a location That I might need to set up a postal redirect also occurred to me. I have very little post coming to my flat presently so I could probably get away with just changing some addresses. However there’s always the chance I’d miss one.\nI don’t know how long I’ll be at my next place of residence as I now know I’m staying with a work colleague for a while. After that, I’ll be moving again, my hope is that the move will be to somewhere I own and then I’ll be there for a long long time.\nBut I got to thinking that the postal system is hideously outdated. Why do I hand out an address of a physical location, rather than handing out an address relating to me and then registering a postal address with one central body whom would join the dots. Similar to DNS.\nGoogle don’t hand out the ip address to their servers, they give us a friendly name to reach it by and it’s registered what ip address(es) that name related to.\nModern Living = Modern Solution So I’d like to propose the above decoupling of physical location from person and also propose that doctors surgeries allow for a wider catchment area and if I can make it to a surgery under my own steam within an hour or so I should be allowed to not have to keep chopping and changing doctors.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/why-the-nhs-and-postal-service-need-an-update/","tags":["health","modern living","NHS","post","royal mail"],"title":"Why The NHS And Postal Service Need An Update"},{"categories":["Personal"],"contents":"“Complaining Is Stupid.

Sometimes a little quip, whilst on the surface is innocuous, can add a little more negativity to a comment than needed.\nAll this small negatives build up and can have a greater effect.\nIt’s important to feature some positiveness in your day too and to take stock of the good things too. Often these can be overlooked because they are actually part of the norm, or just because we don’t look at them.\nFor instance, on a day-to-day basis it can seem like you haven’t achieved much, but looking at the bigger picture, a week, a month, a year, you can see that actually you have made great progress, which should not be overlooked.\nMaybe put a note in your diary to once a week look at just the positives, if you can’t find any within that week, look to that month, and if you can’t find any that month, look at the year.\nYou could also use this opportunity to make a note of some positive things you want to achieve in the coming week.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/negativity/","tags":null,"title":"Negativity"},{"categories":["Apple","Technology"],"contents":"IOS6 Is Coming IOS 6 looks to be certain for this Monday’s Apple Keynote, along with what we suspect is a new iPhone and every item in their arsenal, aside the iPad, getting a little something something.\nApple Sitting On It’s Laurels After reading Gizmodo’s article and agreeing with much of what they wanted I started thinking about features I’d like to see in IOS 6.\nI would really like to see a complete revamp of the UI. I think Apple has been sitting still for far too long with this and are fallen behind. Apple were the innovators in this field when they brought out the first iPhone. But now we are doing so much more with these devices and how we are using them has changed, and yet Apple’s UI is barely distinguishable from IOS1, where as Microsoft have come along and dropped a fantastic UI on us that just seems to make a lot more sense. So much sense that they have essentially clones this UI for there new Desktop OS Windows 8.\nWhat Would I Like To See? 1. Intelligent App Icons As someone who has far too many apps on his phone, most of which I don’t use, but don’t get round to removing. Some apps I only need on a monthly or quarterly basis but are needed. I would love to see usage based intelligent folders and App icon placement.\nIf I use an app every single day, it should be on my front springboard screen. If I use it once a month, on the second or third screen as it can fit.\nThe less I use an app the further back it slips in the screens till it get’s relegated to a folder.\nUsers should be able to over ride this. But I think this makes a lot of sense.\n2. Better Use Of The Notification Centre Every app you install that might want to use notifications prompts you and because all you really want to do is use the application to see if it’s any good, you just hit OK, rather than looking into what types of notifications it will use.\nAs a result the notification centre becomes a message of notifications and so useless. To fix this you have to go through the settings of notification settings, dipping into each application’s settings and tweak them appropriately.\nThe default settings should be either something you can set yourself in the IOS settings or set by Apple to something sensible. That way you could set that default are for nothing to use notification centre and add the ones you want to later, a list which is likely to be far shorter than the ones you don’t.\nI also would quite like it if they made the Clear button larger. I think most people would, especially as there is no clear all button and you have to double tap each one.\n3. Better Use Of Screen Real Estate Look at your home screen now… go on… take a look… what’s all those gaps about between the icons? They are giant! Now if you JailBreak your iPhone you can fit 5 icons wide in there… with a UI overhaul you could probably fit more in there, or have bigger, and, as Gizmodo’s article suggests, more useful icons too.\n4. 11 Home Screens Max?? I really can’t work out why Apple limited the amount of home screens you can have to just 11.

My flatmates work shifts so I do regularly know when that is. Whilst part of me was thinking I should hold out, see if the prices come down and see if maybe a LTE version was on the cards.\nAfter all you can’t play multiplayer games on the 3G of PS Vita sadly.\nBut I bit the bullet anyway in desperate need of some gaming.\nTry before you buy I didn’t just sail straight into a shop and buy it of course. I’d played around on several PS Vita in the shops. I had a go at a few games, but none of the games really let you experience the new hardware features. And the games they had on show were not ones designed to show off the graphics hardware to its maximum too.\nBut I played as much as I could and got the feel for the Vita.\nFirst Impressions First thing’s first, dual analog sticks! I’ve still no idea why these weren’t on the PSP in the first place. The gaming experience transfers straight to the PS Vita, I’m looking forward to Call of Duty and the like coming out later this year on the PS Vita.\nImmersive Experience Playing Uncharted: Golden Abyss really showed the possibilities for using the extra hardware. For example, thru the game you find relics that you need to take rubbings off, so you use the touchscreen to take the rubbing. You discover relics which you use the rear touch panel to turn them, whilst using the touchscreen to clean them and find clues.\nBut some of the best bits of additional immersion come when you only just make a jump and have to swipe up on the touch screen to save your character from falling, the urgency of needing to change your thought process and hand position on the Vita make for an adrenaline kick. Another bit of immersion that I thought was a nice touch was when you find a document that you have to hold up to the light to see the writing on. Using the PS Vita’s rear camera you actually have to hold the document up to a bright light to reveal the text and proceed.\nI look forward to seeing how game designers are going to use these hardware features in their games to enhance the experience. I think that Uncharted has given them a lot of good ideas to think about and hopefully use as a springboard for their own ideas.\nDo we really need a dedicated handheld console? Part of my first few moments with the Vita I kind of felt like most of this hardware, and so possibilities, already exist on an iPhone and iPad, and other table and smart phone hardware, so did I need a dedicated device.\nI knew the answer quick enough, yes! Whilst I do play the occasional game on my iPhone and on my tablet, there is no longevity in the experience for me. Mostly because of the lack of physical controls, but also, as much as there are many games for the iPhone, and no doubt games developers will get more and more involved with this market, but at this point, the best games are made for PCs and games consoles.\nI think this will hold true for some time. Could you image paying £40 or so for a game for your tablet or smart phone? No, neither can I. Spending more than about £3 on an app for my phone or tablet is something that I think about twice.\nBut gamers will, not so begrudgingly, pay that for a PC of console game.\nAll in all I’m pleased with my purchase, and I’m addicted to playing Uncharted at the moment, which means I’m whipping thru the game very quickly and have already bought another game from the PSN.\nThe PS Vita Interface This brings me on to the PS Vita interface. It’s ok, it’ll do for the moment, and it’s refreshing they haven’t just plonked the usual Sony interface on it. But it does need some work. It’s a bit clunky and when you double press the PS button it feels like there’s actually two interfaces on there.\nMy biggest bugbear with the interface is that it’s not entirely clear when your actions are going to close another ‘app’/game until you click another app or game and you are prompted that this will close the last game or app you had open.\nThis would be easy enough to work out if it was the case with all apps and all games, but it’s not, so the pop up warning is almost always a surprise when it pops up.\nI don’t feel like I should have to leave the game I’m playing to browse the web on my Vita.\nMy only other real gripe is that the WiFi connection options are still sparse. I can happily connect to my home WiFi, but I can’t connect to my work WiFi network, which I run, to either our eduroam wireless connection or to our guest WiFi, which doesn’t use 802.1x authentication and so should just connect and then give you the captive portal when you try to browse a webpage.\nWhat’s more is that it’s not apparent that it’s failing to connect, except for the lack of Internet access.\nConclusions I’m very pleased with my purchase, gripes aside, and it feels much more like a proper gaming experience. My PSP’s graphics are now dated and games trying to fit a lot on the screen end up looking like old Sega Master System games. But on the PS Vita you can get lost in the nice beautifully big screen. Even when you are zoomed out in wide shots in Uncharted you can see what is going on and enjoy the game thoroughly.\nI’m looking forward to see what games come out for the PS Vita, and I hope the gaming industry get’s right behind it!\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/ps-vita-my-review/","tags":["console","gaming","psvita","sony"],"title":"PS Vita: My Review"},{"categories":null,"contents":"MikeDixson.com will never sell or misuse any of your personal details.

A few unavoidable things have come up that have meant I’ve not always been able to cook for myself. However I have been making better choices largely.\nFrugle = Not Fruity One factor has made it hard to make as healthy choices as I’d like to though. Coca Cola’s evil work. I went to the cinema, as I don’t do it often so I decided a hot dog was an o.k. treat, not great, but o.k. as a treat. I just wanted a small drink of something healthy to wash it down with and drink thru the movie. However that was going to cost me a metric poop ton of money, but if I had a giant, and I mean as big as my head, cola, it would be cheaper.\n\u0026#8220;WTF?\u0026#8221; I bit the bullet and went for the cola, resolute to only drink what I needed from it, as little as possible. So aside from when I had a choking fit in the cinema and had to clear my throat I barely drunk any of this monster drink.\nFruit juice company’s need to be slutty If fruit juice companies start getting in bed with cinemas etc like Coke do then surely I could be drinking a lovely fruit juice or water or such, instead of this head sized carton of sugar?\nCan we vote with our feet/mouths? When the choices are weighted as such can we be expected to vote with our feet/mouths as to what we’d rather have. If the prices were equal I probably would have had just a water that day as I’d already had a couple of fruit juices. But when the cinema tickets cost so much and the other food products cost are upto 85% profit then every penny starts to count.\nIf I’m heading out to the cinema in the future I’ll be smuggling in a bottle of water. I this what it’s come to?\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/i-fricking-love-coca-cola-diet-update/","tags":["cola","diet","dieting","weight loss"],"title":"I Fricking Love Coca Cola?

Always happy to see visitors, and hopeful that what I write is useful to people.\nI got to thinking and a few google searches later leave me thinking that it’s nothing I didn’t know already.\n1. Make text scannable Not just to search engines, but most importantly the human eye. I always think newspapers are a great example of this. Headlines grab your attention and dangle their bait in front of you luring you into read the story.\nUsing paragraphs and white space to break up the text well is another good tip, and another one well employed by newspapers.\n2. Say something interesting This is so obvious it’s obscene. If you’re not saying anything anyone wants to hear then why would anyone listen?\n3. Speak to your audience This bit is maybe the hardest. Whilst I know who is most likely to read this at the moment, whilst it’s in it’s infancy, I hope to speak to a wider community.\nI don’t really want to prescribe that but I guess I have to in a way so I’m speaking to you in the right way.\n4. Use Lists Who doesn’t love a list? High Fidelity’s Top 5 lists running throughout the film, the charts, your todo list. You might hate all the todos but having them in a list is your way to tame the those beasts.\n5. Use Pictures Pictures scan well, grab attention quickly and add some eye candy that text just can’t cut. Often a photo can sum up a story quicker and give the reader more than you can say in a 1000 words.\n6. Keep it short Short and concise.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/what-make-for-a-great-blog-post/","tags":["blog","Blogging","journalism","writing"],"title":"What makes for a great blog post?"},{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"contents":"\nSnapped on my way home.

So I have up’d my exercise amount, lowered the amount of food I’m eating, and I’m eating healthier foods.\nIt’s actually been pretty easy to make the changes. However what’s not been hard is being hungry all the time. The only time I’ve not been hungry is when I had a protein burst in the form of a turkey stir fry for dinner. Turkey being lower in fat than chicken. 🙂\nHopefully tomorrow will be easier as I cooked double the portions for dinner tonight and the other half is in the fridge for lunch tomorrow.\nI won’t blog continually about weight loss and such but these first few steps/changes are the important ones so I feel it’s best to put something down about them.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/first-wobbly-steps/","tags":["diet","dieting","loss","weight","Weightloss"],"title":"First wobbly steps"},{"categories":["Weight Loss"],"contents":"Well I knew I’d put on some weight, but was shocked to see the scale telling me I was 14 Stone this morning.\nSo now it’s time to sort this out, and in a stable and maintainable way too. So firstly I’ll start with the easy kills. I drink a lot of cola, so I’m going to kill that completely. That’s one of the easiest ways for me to lose weight and fat so it’s a no brainer. I think the next thing to do is start food shopping better. It’s too easy to pick up things in the shop that you can just slam in the oven or microwave and then eat, but invariably they are not the healthy choices.\nSo I’m going to put a bit more mindfulness into my shopping. Stir fry isn’t a bad option, especially with the veg to meat ratio I cook it with, so I’ll buy plenty of ingredients for that. I’ll also look on http://www.bbcgoodfood.com/content/healthy/ for some recipes. As far as I know it can even make you your shopping list. So it should be another relatively easy to make healthy choice.\nNext comes increasing my exercise. About a year ago I was hitting the gym around 6 times a week and loving it. I had a nice little set up where I could easily go to two different branches of a gym, one I preferred for the weights set up, but was farther away and so I’d cycle there for my warm up, and another that was close enough that I could go before work without being late.\nI’ve changed flats and gyms since and I’ve not managed to fit the gym in so neatly and so it’s rather fallen by the wayside. So I need to think up the best way for me to start slipping in exercise into my daily routine easily first. Once I get back into my passion for it will take over and I’ll be exercising more easily.\nThis one is going to require some thought, but there are a few options. I still have my gym membership, and so just need to work out what evenings I head to the gym instead of home or elsewhere. I also can ride to work. I’ve not tried it from this current flat, so I will give that a go next week and see how that goes.\nMy will to cycle into work will be heavily affected by the weather, and so I can’t count on it as a form of regular exercise, just as a supplemental.\nLet’s see how I get on. ","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/14-stone-wobble/","tags":["bmi","exercise","fat","loss","weight"],"title":"14 Stone Wobble"},{"categories":["Uncategorized"],"contents":"\nThere’s just something about it’s wirey silhouette that was appealing.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/just-had-to-shoot-this/","tags":null,"title":"Just had to shoot this"},{"categories":["Web Design"],"contents":"My brother Greg Dixson has been learning a lot about web design recently.

Piracy, is wrong, most of us have pirated something in our time, even if it was copying a friends cassette or cd so you could have a copy of an album your mate owns, in our hearts we all know we’re being a little bit naughty when we do it.\nHere’s the thing, the music and film industry don’t care too much if you are recording a film off TV at home that they own the rights too, or record a copy of a song off the radio. It’s small scale, it’s not really affecting their bottom line.\nThey care when it starts to make their fat wallets thinner and makes them look inaffective at protecting their intellectual properly.\nHowever the gist of it is that as long as the amount of legal plays/buys of a song/movie Vs the amount of pirated copies of a song or movie is in their favour and keeps their wallets fat they won’t really give a rats arse.\nSo why not embrace the new digital landscape, why not make music and movies so easy to get and reasonably priced that piracy seems like idiocy?\nSince buying a Spotify premium account subscription I’ve been lovingly listening to more new albums than I ever did before. I’ve been able to share these tracks via Spotify to friends and colleagues, and instead of a radio playing in the office now we have Spotify playing with a collaborative playlist that we all add tracks to.

Text books are heavy and dull, and largely in some ugly typeface that is hard on the eyes, so by all means makes them available as an ebook.\nHowever Neil Johnston believes that tablet computers will enable teacher to facilitate teaching at different speeds/levels in a single class. I’m unclear how this magic would happen, unless the under paid teacher is likely to want to spend three times the amount of time working on class plans for three different levels that all tie in together at key points so that the teacher can orate on them.\nI’m all for students learning at their own levels, I believe that it encourages great growth and keeps students interested in their studies, instead of waiting for everyone to catch up with you or feeling like you are never going to catch up to others.\nBut this is more an argument for virtual learning environment(online learning), and having the whole class plan/notes available and having students progress at a pace that is comfortable to them. In this case the teach becomes almost like a project manager, ensuring that the students stay on schedule for their milestones, but allowing students who are so inclined to zoom ahead.\nThis would also allow for some learning disabilities to be catered for, larger text for people with learning disabilities, colour schemes adjusted for accessibility, etc.\nI do agree that this is an excellent opportunity for academia to get with the times, but in order to do that teachers/lecturers need to get up to speed, and be completely competent with the Operating System and Office applications at least.\nStudents need to emerge out of secondary school completely familiar with computers and, perhaps more importantly, the ability to investigate and work out how to use a new applications or systems without having to be walked thru it.\nThe tablet is not a magic bullet, no bit of technology is really, but how people use technology and continue to do so is important, and the future of computing in the classroom depends on all parties involved investing themselves in the technology, not being afraid to work with it and to be creative in the ideas that they come up with for how the can get more use out of the technology in the classroom.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/tablets-will-not-cure-all-that-ails-you/","tags":null,"title":"Tablet’s will not cure all that ails you"},{"categories":["Productivity","Technology"],"contents":"I’m lazy and forgetful, not in a bad way, but I don’t like to do more than I have to if I can simplify something and streamline it, and I have a bad memory for the more mundane things.\nSo when I was asked to keep a work log I cited some problems.

I also don’t know anyone at work who get’s a regular paper on their way in.\nI’ve been enjoying the Guardian’s iPhone app. I’d never read the guardian before but actually got some semi-regular use out of the app, particularly as I could just read those sections and contributor’s columns that I enjoyed. However now they’ve introduced a new app with a charging model. The price is very reasonable at £3 per month and comes with a few new features over the old app. However it’s still a subscription model. For occasional newspaper readers like myself and everyone I know at work a subscription isn’t what they are after.\nAnd so I got to thinking how comes Newspaper publishers, who were so fearful of change, have moved to a model where you can’t replicate the real world activity of being able to buy just one news paper.\nEven if this translates to paying a one off fee for a period of access those people who don’t want to sign up to a recurring subscription don’t seem to be being catered for and are a missed business opportunity.\nI hope that Newspaper publishers redress this oversight and allow the occasional buyers access and themselves to get the extra revenue to realise new media is not a threat, it’s an opportunity.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/the-future-of-newspapers/","tags":null,"title":"The future of newspapers"},{"categories":["Ideas"],"contents":"Via gizmodo.com, and email a couple of webbased service pricing changes that affect me came to light this week.\nMozy.com is cutting it’s unlimited service to a tiered pricing system. There’s a couple of things that suck about this, firstly a service that was costing me in the region of £3 per month, and I was backing up 350GB too was now going to cost me over £22, and secondly they only gave half a month’s notice in which to decide and either migrate your data or pay up.\nNow it took me the best part of a month to back up my data in the first place with Mozy.\nI’m now in the process of backing up to Carbonite which will cost £5 a month for unlimited backups.\nI can see that an unlimited model can be unsustainable, you will always end up with some people abusing it, but with that sort of offer you are playing the averages game, assuming that most won’t and so are covering the costs of those who will.\nWhy they jumped the pricing up quite so much I do not know. They are going to lose customers in great swathes.\nThey cited trying to make customers more aware of the data they are backing up, but surely this defeats the set it and forget it motto that they use to sell the product in the first place.\nI’m curious why they opted for a model which costs users so steeply. Switich to Carbonite has nearly doubled my cost of back up but is still a negligible cost for an offsite backup for me, where as Mozy’s new model was a hike I couldn’t swallow.\nLast.fm is the other network based service that is changing it’s pricing model. Now wanting users to have premium accounts in order to stream to devices.\nI’ve got no issue with a great service like Last.fm trying to have a workable long term model, but I think this change is lacking in a couple of ways.\nI use a Sonos S5 for my music needs at home, and often stream Last.FM via it, in fact far more than I used to on my computer. Thru Last.fm I discovered new artists based on artists I already liked or by listening to Last.fm ‘radio’ stations based on a tag. If I liked a artist enough I’d go and buy their album.\nSo here’s a few thoughts, shouldn’t the record companies be paying Last.fm a subscription fee to keep playing artists on their label and enabling new listeners to find their artists.\nAlso now, I can listen to Last.fm for free on my computer and even put that thru a line out into my Sonos to get the same audio quality, but I can’t use my Sonos S5 to listen to last.fm directly without paying £3 a month.\nMaybe they should move to an ad supports free version like Spotify and premium users get no ads.\nMy issue is that for £3 a month, I get the same service I’ve had for free for years, nothing extra as far as I can see, no exclusive offers, or even the option to choose which artist’s album I want to listen to and listening to in it’s entirety, no I get to listen to a random selection of songs based on one criteria I specify.\nAt which point I have to question, do I pay £3 for discovering music, or do I pay £10 for spotify and then get the option to listen to albums I want to hear and be able to download them for offline playing on my iPhone?\nLast.FM I’m an advocate of yours, I want you to succeed, I want to support you, but you’re not offering me anything that I can’t get for free.

GPS wasn’t so prevalent when I was dreaming up my idea but both ideas contain the key factor. The fact that you can pick up a bike from one location and drop it off at another.\nFor years I travelled into work, the majority of my journey being on an overground rail line into London Bridge station and then I had to negotiate the shorter distance to Shoreditch. I looked into getting a folder bike at the time but I would have nowhere to store it at/near work.\nAs such I resorted to buses and tubes, much preferring to be above ground when possible, especially in summer.\nMore recently I live within walking distance of a tube line and have got rid of my car as driving across London was an unpredictable drain on time, any one incident on the way could add between 30 to 60 minutes on a journey. Many of the journeys I could get a tube, but many more I would happily have been able to cycle had I had anywhere to store my bike at the other end. London is addressing this with more and more cycle rack to lock your bike to, but when you want to be able to change plans at a moments notice, as is common in the thriving London you having the system that Trek is putting in place in Denver makes even more sense.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/this-is-the-future-of-transport-in-london/","tags":null,"title":"This is the Future of Transport in London"},{"categories":["Ideas"],"contents":"www.twitter.com/tinybuddha‘s post http://bit.ly/dwYuNh I’m inspired to think 2 things:\nThere is no digital replacement for a hug.

Really I want to be able to find tv shows based on a load of symantec data. I want to be able to say I’m interested in these topics, now plot me a days tv watching based on my interests.\nThe other thing that occurs to me is what will the future of tv broadcasting and scheduling look like. It’s already less linear than it was with things like iplayer and itv on demand etc.\nSo when there’s a cloud of recorded shows floating around in the ether what’s going to be the method for scheduling shows then, will it be entirely pulled by the user or will broadcasters broadcast a set schedule even though you can realistically watch the show whenever?\nI wonder what the industry has in mind?

I don’t have anything against the iPad, it’s just not an eBook Reader, it doesn’t have ePaper and so the reading experience is going to hard on the eyes for a full book.\nBut where I worry publishers might really screw the pooch with the iPad is by losing the point of what a book is. A book is a collection of information, whether that’s a story or a text book. If you watch Penguin Books’ iPad presentation here you can see they want to make books a more interactive thing. Great, for kids books, and if done in the right way great for adult books. But these guys are publishers, not technologists and so unless they get the right people on board sooner rather than later books are going to get ugly.\nKevin Rose of Digg.com spoke about some of the possibilities for ebooks on the iPad with some interesting ideas. I like the idea of linking the book with your social networks. So as you’re reading you can see who else you know is reading this book, chapter, even page. I like the idea for encyclopaedias of making them media rich, and hyperlinking. So you’re reading something about Winston Churchill and you can play a video or audio clip of one of his speeches. Then it says about Sir Anthony Eden, the Prime Minister who followed after Churchill with a link to the entry. Penguin, comparatively, look like they might be going over the top.\nMy other fear is that publishers will panda to the iPad and make these bright colourful media rich eBooks that will be no use on eBook readers. From what I understand about eBook formats the iPad eBooks that Penguin are looking to publish are in ePub format. Which is a format readable by eBook readers, but how will it look? Are they testing their books on these readers too.\nIf I buy my BeBook One now will it be obsolete by the end of the year?\nMy last concern, I’d like to be able to replace all my current books with eBooks so I keep my existing library and can add to it in the future. However not every book coming out is available as an eBook. Publishers really need to pull their finger out on this. Embrace that this change is here and work out their position on it. I hope that publishers have a road map here and that they are talking to the hardware providers too.\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/ebooks-publishers-dont-screw-the-pooch-on-this-one-please/","tags":null,"title":"eBooks – Publishers Don’t Screw The Pooch on This One Please"},{"categories":["Household","Ideas"],"contents":"This is a half formed thought so far but I’m banging it up here anyway.

You could wake to an epic sunrise and fall asleep to a beautiful sunset, you could gaze at the stars or watch the Aurora Borealis, all from the comfort of your own home.\nThen consider that OLED tv will soon be with us and you can imagine the next convergence technology that’s hot will be TVs sold and OLED wallpaper. Imagine being able to sit in your front room and decide you want a 52″ tv on your wall right in front of your line of vision, with a few gestures recognized by the system controlling your OLED wallpaper image their you have it. You want to do some work on your computer whilst watching tv, you gesture into existence a 15″ monitor on the wall next to the tv and using a remote device or maybe more high definition gesture recognition where you type in on a projected keyboard on your lap, you tap away on a few emails.\nA few friend drop round and you want to watch a film together so you gesture the screen larger on your wall to fill the whole wall and enjoy a film together.\nThe next day you’re off to a meeting at a clients office in a part of town you don’t know, you bring up Google maps and your email on your wall, you copy and paste the address into Google maps and find it, you hit street view to help you get your bearing ahead of time and your are immersed in a full wall street view that you can drag around to see where the office is, where’s the nearest place to get coffee and lunch.\nThe next step from this is of course full wall video conferencing, your room can easily become an immersive multi-environment. For example, you could chat with friends from around the world and all feel like you’re sitting in the same room, you could virtually be in the office at your desk, seeing other’s sitting at their desks, all on your walls. You could play a game panning round your whole room, checking behind you before looking round the corner and rushing the guard.\nThis is all surely just the tip of the ice berg for OLED wallpaper with the innovative minds of the world coming up with creative ways of rendering content from all forms of media and sources on your wall in beautiful ways.\nMikeD\n","permalink":"https://mikedixson.com/oled-wallpaper-and-all-that-comes-with-it/","tags":["conferencing","gaming","immersive reality","OLED","wallpaper"],"title":"OLED Wallpaper and all that comes with it"},{"categories":["General","Ideas"],"contents":"As someone who is naturally very creative and also naturally very lazy I’ve always been one to have bright ideas but not to put them into action.\nIt’s come to my attention lately that my ideas are becoming predictions and several of my ideas have crept into the real world without my participation.
