      <description>&lt;p&gt;So you might be on the ball enough to change your Facebook, or Google settings to use HTTPS, the secure way to browse websites. However when you fire up your Facebook or your bank app on your smart phone are you still being smart? Is it using secure protocols to talk to the servers or is everything you do being sent in clear text over your coffee shop’s wireless network.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s reasonable to assume that the lack of up roar from the geek community means it is secure, but with no visual indication of this end users aren’t to know. Stats mentioned in the news lately suggest that app usage is starting to outstrip website usage. This is fine for most end users, however it should be done right and securely, and there should be transparency if this security to the end user.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
