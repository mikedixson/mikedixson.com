      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today I made steps to further my playing with HDR. A little urbex jaunt so I thought I’d take my, much underused, tripod along. Using this I’ve been able to shoot 3-6 different exposure levels for shots.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;This should give me a fantastic dynamic range which I think could lend itself to urbex well. The human eye can see such amazing contrast ratios technology has yet to come close in one shot, but hopefully I can bring the light to the shadows using this technique.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m not going to end up doing all shots in HDR, some shots I only took the one exposure level and others that I don’t think benefit from HDR I will select the best exposure level from the ones I shot and process it in Lightroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Additionally I shot a few photos on my phone just where there was no way for me to get the shot I wanted with my lens. I’ll add one to this post to give you an idea what we experienced.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mikedixson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/20120527-233342.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://mikedixson.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/20120527-233342.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;20120527-233342.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
