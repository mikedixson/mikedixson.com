      <description>&lt;p&gt;Well I did say, &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikedixson.com/2012/03/i-feel-a-theme-coming-on/&#34; title=&#34;I Feel A Theme Coming On&#34;&gt;I felt a theme coming on&lt;/a&gt;, and so tada!!! Here it is. It’s not the most widely different theme. But it’s built as a child theme on the &lt;a title=&#34;WordPress.org&#34; href=&#34;http://wordpress.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt;‘s default theme. I did this for a couple of reasons. FIrstly so I could play with child themes, but mainly so that it’s sustainable. When I update the parent theme my child theme should (in theory) not need any modification in order to keep working.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Of course I’ll test any theme updates on my staging site first to be sure of that.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;There was an additional bonus of using the &lt;a title=&#34;WordPress.org&#34; href=&#34;http://WordPress.org&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;WordPress.org&lt;/a&gt; theme. It seems to be responsive. So, with only mild aesthetic tweaking my theme also works on tablets and smart phones.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I think this theme expresses a bit of my character and style and I’m very pleased with it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
