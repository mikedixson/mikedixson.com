      <description>&lt;p&gt;After finishing editing and wim image using dism I was being left with Windows still thinking the image was still mounted somehow and not able to remount the image file.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Thanks to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://trueliarx.blogspot.com/2014/07/force-unmount-and-clean-up-of-wim-image.html#comment-form&#34;&gt;post&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://trueliarx.blogspot.com/2014/07/force-unmount-and-clean-up-of-wim-image.html#comment-form&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; I finally managed to resolve the issue by deleting keys under “HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\WIMMount\mounted images&amp;amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next I just need to find how to be able to delete the folders ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\SystemData underneath the root of a mounted image after it’s been unmounted. Windows is locking them but there are no handles open to them&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
