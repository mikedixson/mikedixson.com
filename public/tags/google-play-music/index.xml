      <description>&lt;p&gt;I love Spotify as a service. I use it all the time and love being able to find and listen to new music as soon as its out.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;However whilst trying to play the latest Ben Folds Five album to a friend whilst telling him how good it was I found that it was no longer available. This was an album I had listened to numerous time in Spotify, so I &lt;strong&gt;was&lt;/strong&gt; available, and now it was gone.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;A bit of a search online and I found that it’s only available in the US.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;I don’t know why Sony have decided to do this. But even looking to by the album now on Google Play music store it’s not available.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I could understand if they’d made it available to a particular digital music provider for a exclusive limited period, that makes great sense for the  music service. However to have it available on a broad range of platforms and then pull it like going backwards.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Come on music industry, get with the times. You make me want to pirate music I was happily paying for before!&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mikedixson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wpid-220px-Thesoundofthelifeofthemind.jpg&#34;&gt;&lt;img title=&#34;220px-Thesoundofthelifeofthemind.jpg&#34; class=&#34;alignnone size-full&#34; alt=&#34;image&#34; src=&#34;https://mikedixson.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/wpid-220px-Thesoundofthelifeofthemind.jpg&#34; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
