      <description>&lt;p&gt;So since making my post &lt;a href=&#34;http://mikedixson.com/2012/03/14-stone-wobble/&#34;&gt;14 Stone Wobble&lt;/a&gt; Iâ€™ve been making the changes I said I would. So I have upâ€™d my exercise amount, lowered the amount of food Iâ€™m eating, and Iâ€™m eating healthier foods.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Itâ€™s actually been pretty easy to make the changes. However whatâ€™s not been hard is being hungry all the time. The only time Iâ€™ve not been hungry is when I had a protein burst in the form of a turkey stir fry for dinner. Turkey being lower in fat than chicken. ðŸ™‚&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hopefully tomorrow will be easier as I cooked double the portions for dinner tonight and the other half is in the fridge for lunch tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I wonâ€™t blog continually about weight loss and such but these first few steps/changes are the important ones so I feel itâ€™s best to put something down about them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
