      <description>&lt;p&gt;As someone who is naturally very creative and also naturally very lazy I’ve always been one to have bright ideas but not to put them into action.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s come to my attention lately that my ideas are becoming predictions and several of my ideas have crept into the real world without my participation. Now I’m by no means saying that pixies are coming and stealing my thoughts in the night but I wanted to make my ideas sort of open source. An open source idea would be one that anyone could act on but that I would be credited for coming up with the initial idea, no financial motives here, just pure ego.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following posts will detail an idea of mine as thoroughly as I can.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;MikeD&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
