      <description>&lt;p&gt;This week I’m following week one of &lt;a title=&#34;Mindfulness - A practical guide to peace in a frantic world&#34; href=&#34;http://www.kobobooks.com/ebook/Mindfulness/book-zh9NDKObb02PvlaE02IeKw/page1.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; rel=&#34;noopener&#34;&gt;Mindfulness – A practical guide to peace in a frantic world&lt;/a&gt; and so I’m being more mindful during cleaning my teeth, keeping my mind in the present.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My mind wandered however and volunteered the idea of cleaning teeth using UV light, or at least augmenting the process with UV light. There are plenty of UV toothbrush sterilizers out there, but it doesn’t look like anything that is actually aimed at killing bacteria in the mouth.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;So maybe UV light coming out of a toothbrush head, or could the amount of brushing be reduced and maybe users could just pop in a UV gum shield for 2 minutes and that do?&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
