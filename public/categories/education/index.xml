      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I read the article &lt;a href=&#34;http://mashable.com/2012/01/16/tablet-education/&#34;&gt;Tablets Will Transform the Classroom [OPINION]&lt;/a&gt; I found myself getting increasingly frustrated at this article’s view on what Tablets like the iPad, Galaxy Tab, etc would bring to the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Scraping texts books is one thing, though I suggest that many publishers are still dragging there heels into this century, afraid that everyone will automatically pirate all books and their cash flow will disappear. Text books are heavy and dull, and largely in some ugly typeface that is hard on the eyes, so by all means makes them available as an ebook.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;However &lt;a title=&#34;Posts by Neil Johnston&#34; href=&#34;http://mashable.com/author/neil-johnston/&#34; rel=&#34;author&#34;&gt;Neil Johnston&lt;/a&gt; believes that tablet computers will enable teacher to facilitate teaching at different speeds/levels in a single class. I’m unclear how this magic would happen, unless the under paid teacher is likely to want to spend three times the amount of time working on class plans for three different levels that all tie in together at key points so that the teacher can orate on them.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I’m all for students learning at their own levels, I believe that it encourages great growth and keeps students interested in their studies, instead of waiting for everyone to catch up with you or feeling like you are never going to catch up to others.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;But this is more an argument for virtual learning environment(online learning), and having the whole class plan/notes available and having students progress at a pace that is comfortable to them. In this case the teach becomes almost like a project manager, ensuring that the students stay on schedule for their milestones, but allowing students who are so inclined to zoom ahead.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This would also allow for some learning disabilities to be catered for, larger text for people with learning disabilities, colour schemes adjusted for accessibility, etc.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do agree that this is an excellent opportunity for academia to get with the times, but in order to do that teachers/lecturers need to get up to speed, and be completely competent with the Operating System and Office applications at least.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Students need to emerge out of  secondary school completely familiar with computers and, perhaps more importantly, the ability to investigate and work out how to use a new applications or systems without having to be walked thru it.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The tablet is not a magic bullet, no bit of technology is really, but how people use technology and continue to do so is important, and the future of computing in the classroom depends on all parties involved investing themselves in the technology, not being afraid to work with it and to be creative in the ideas that they come up with for how the can get more use out of the technology in the classroom.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;</description>
